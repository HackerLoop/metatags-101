# Social media metatags templates

Social media metatags allows you to add social information to your website or contents.

When you are sharing an url to social networks, they will find the social information which you defined between head tags. It's with this feature that you can show a custom image when you share something on Facebook for instance.

In order to easily handle this routine on every project, we gather all the right metatags on this repository.
